# Process Definition

This is a **compatibility check** between the **Quranium C library** and the **Noble post-quantum library**.

## Proof

With the current modifications, **interchangeability of functions and keys is proven**.  
Keys generated by **either library** can be used to sign with **either implementation**, and the signatures are **accepted by the Quranium chain**.

---


## Steps to Run

1. **Install the required JavaScript libraries**
   ```sh
   cd src
   npm install
   ```
2. **Compile the C code**
   ```sh
   cd ../cgit/C
   make
   ```
3. **Edit the private key** in both:
   - C code
   - JavaScript code  
   (Test credentials are already included as an option)
4. **Run the CLI**
   ```sh
   cd ../../src
   node cli.js
   ```
5. **Select 1 in the CLI**  
   → Creates the transaction and message hash using **JS**
6. **Run the C file**  
   ```sh
   cd ../cgit/C
   ./trxn
   ```
   → Signs the message hash using **C**
7. **In the CLI, select 3**  
   → Broadcasts and sends the transaction using **JS**

## Current Blocker – Android Integration

While integrating the signing code into the existing Qinvi stable version, we are encountering this runtime error on Android:

<TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...) 'PlatformConstants' could not be found>


### What this means

This error generally indicates one of two issues: 

- The **JavaScript bundle has a loading error**, so native modules don’t initialize correctly. 
- OR **a native dependency is crashing when loaded**, preventing React Native from starting properly. 

In our case, it’s **mostly the second one**.

### Current Suspect

The likely cause is that **libgcrypt is not natively available on Android**.  
To use it we would need to:

- Cross-compile **libgcrypt for Android**
- Bundle it with the app
- Integrate it into the native build and JNI bridge

This is **complex and error-prone**, and without it the native modules fail to load, leading to the observed error.
